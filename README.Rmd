The goal of iuform is to enable the user to easily create online forms. These online forms will be able to collect input
   data from the end users and store it to a user define database.

## Installation

You can install the released version of iuform from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("iuform")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(iuform)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
